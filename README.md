## Deck Dealer Project

# Project Overview
The Deck Dealer project is a creative and interactive system designed to dispense a specified number of playing cards. The user inputs the desired number of cards via a keypad, and the system automatically dispenses the exact amount. This project is ideal for card game enthusiasts and those interested in automated systems.

# Components Required
ELEGOO Mega 2560 R3 Board
Keypad Module
Servo Motor
Card Dispensing Mechanism (details to be designed)
Jumper Wires
Power Supply

# Assembly Instructions
Board and Keypad Connection: Connect the keypad module to the ELEGOO Mega 2560 R3 board using jumper wires. Ensure each pin is correctly connected to the corresponding port on the board.
Servo Motor Setup: Attach the servo motor to the card dispensing mechanism. Connect the servo to the Mega board.
Mechanism Assembly: Assemble the card dispensing mechanism. Ensure it's capable of holding a deck of cards and can push one card at a time.
Power Supply: Connect your power supply to the ELEGOO Mega board, ensuring it provides adequate power for the servo and the board.

# Software Overview
Arduino IDE Setup: Use the Arduino IDE to program the ELEGOO Mega 2560 R3 board.
Keypad Input Handling: Write a script to read inputs from the keypad and store the entered number.
Servo Motor Control: Implement a function to activate the servo motor to dispense cards based on the keypad input.

#Additional Notes
Test each component separately before full assembly.
Ensure the power supply is disconnected while assembling.
Follow safety guidelines while working with electronic components.
